## How to Play

To stop enemies from reaching and damaging your base, you’ll need to build turrets from the panel on the right. More turrets will be unlocked as you progress through the waves.

If any enemy is red/appears to be quickly growing & shrinking, this is an advanced enemy which cannot be killed by turrets. You’ll need to sacrifice a human to kill him: Do this by clicking a human from the top panel then clicking the enemy.

You can used WASD or arrow keys to scroll the camera view and get around the map.
